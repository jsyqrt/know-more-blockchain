To know more about blockchain related technologies, a resource collection.

In this readme file I will collect blockchain related insights and links to help me know more about blockchain technology.

## Introduction

Blockchain is becoming a revolutionary technology as many claims. There are several basic blocks to build a well functioning blockchain system.

What is blockchain?

* Blockchain is a recording, a storage, a large wide database that keeps recording what's happening in the network.

Why does blockchain matter?

* It provides trust and credit on happened events between participants. Thus every events happened at the physical world could be mapped to the digital world in a trusted way which will greatly improve the efficiency of business activities in the physical world, also it is possible to create new economic forms.

How does it work?

* ... consensus mechanism, cryptography tools, network model, virtual machine and smart contract, data structure and storage, synchronization mechanism, account model, application and deployment.
